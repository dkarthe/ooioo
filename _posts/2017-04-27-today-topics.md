Toolwiz Photos is made by a group of crazy guys. The team has a dream to make the best all in one android app
for art enthusiasts. To make this dream come true, the team has worked day and night for almost 1 years now.
Nearly no holidays and very little sleep. No matter what you request for in your emails, these guys try their best
to implement it for you in the next release.
It has been very difficult to make one huge APP like Toolwiz Photos. Especially for a group of people with high school degrees. The men who made all the filters are congenital hemophilia patients. The developer who made the core engine is a congenital deafness patient. Converting these barriers into strengths, the young team keeps moving forward to produce the most amazing tools for you to use.

Congratulations, you finally found the right tool. Lets rock the world!
